Start your day feasting on some Kitcha Fitfit and end your nights with a glass of <strong><a target="blank" href="https://trip101.com/article/traditional-food-in-eritrea"> Suwa</a></strong>. Even though you get an amazing cup of cappuccino here, thanks to the Italian influence over the region, we recommend you take part in the traditional coffee drinking ceremony at least once!<a class="top-ten" target="blank" href="https://thetravelhackinglife.com/top-10-traditional-eritrean-foods/"> Read this list to know more about the top 10 traditional foods of Eritrea.</a></p>

  <h2>Zigni</h2>
   <div class="box">           <img id="zigni" src="https://media-cdn.greatbritishchefs.com/media/sgdhpty1/img75699.jpg?mode=crop&width=768&height=512"  alt="tsebhi-zigni">
              </div>
  <p class="zigni" >If one dish had to define <em>Eritrean cuisine</em>, <strong>Zigni</strong> would be it. Rich, meaty and flavorful, this stew is the staple fare of the locals. The base is a spice mix, known as ‘berbere’ which is simmered in tomatoes for a long time to let the flavours develop. Variations of this dish depends on the meat used. The most popular addition is beef, followed by other meats such as mutton (lamb), chicken and even vegetables. Do try this at one of the numerous cafes in the capital city Asmara.</p>
  <h2>Shiro</h2>

    <img id="shiro" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gaweAZ3mtZ4/maxresdefault.jpg" alt ="shiro-photo">
              </div>
  <p class="shiro">This is another delicious, soul-warming vegetarian option from the Eritrean region. Shiro is a thick, almost paste-like stew made from powdered chickpeas. Think of it as an elevated hummus, spiced by the quintessential berbere. It usually has onions, garlic, and tomatoes mixed in. It is a low-cost option for many families.</p>
  <h2>Derho</h2>
   <div class="box"> 
  <img  id="derho" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yVO_kBHljXQ/hqdefault.jpg" alt="tsebhi-derho">
              </div>
  <p class="derho">Being one of the most famous African foods, Dorho truly deserves to be on the list. Like all dishes originating from Eritrea, Dorho too is cooked in the berbere spice mix. The stew has an entire chicken in it, in the usual base of tomatoes and onions which are simmered for a long time to lend their flavour to the dish. It is commonly served as an accompaniment to Injera bread. Boiled eggs are the final touch and add a dash of colour to the otherwise fiery red stew!</p>
  <h2>Ga'at</h2>
  <div class="box"> 
  <img id="gaat" src=" https://www.ecaq.org.au/sites/default/files/images/3.jpg" alt="ga'at">
              </div>
  <p class="gaat">Ga'at is an <strong>easily digestible</strong> food made using coarsely ground cornmeal. The meal is hydrated with some water until it thickens, forming something similar to polenta. It is then served on a plate with a hole in the middle, quite resembling a volcano! A bubbling mixture of clarified butter and spices are poured into the hole, to add depth to the dish. The final touches are dollops of fresh yoghurt around the cake to cool down the palate.</p></div>
